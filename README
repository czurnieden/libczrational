This is the library "libczrational" offering some functions to calculate
with fractions of arbitrary size. It uses Libtommath for the core multiple
precision arithmetic with some extensions by the author. If the version at
https://github.com/libtom/libtommath is not sufficient you'll need the author's
version at https://github.com/czurnieden/libtommath which is downward compatible
to the original Libtommath.

  Included are functions to do

    - basic exact arithmetic (x,-,*,/,^)
    - basic inexact arithmetic (e.g.: square roots)
    - integer functions (e.g.: Bernoulli and Euler numbers)

Please refer to the documentation in the /doc directory for usage, to the
file INSTALL for some remarks regarding building and installation and to the
file LICENSE for some legal information (tl,dr: do with this software what
you want as long as you put content of the file LICENSE into the packet when
you distribute it. That's all.).

This sentence gets deleted when the library is deemed useful by enough
