The build process uses qmake (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qmake) but not the
QT library--the code is plain C-99. That means that it compiles, theoretically,
with every compiler that understands C-99 (but none of the more exotic C-99
specialties were used), on Unix, Windows and MacOS-X and qmake makes the
building process much simpler overall, although a bit more complicated in
detail and after a lot of time spend with qmake the author comes, slowly, to
he conclusion, that qmake is bit _too_ simple.
The other cross-platform option is cmake.

  For Linux (prepared on Debian Squeeze)

    make
  optional (you'll need to be root for that)
    make install
    ldconfig

  That will build, hopefully, static and dynamic libraries, the program
    test_library
  and, at your option, installs them. Yes, including the program, I haven't
  found out how to avoid that part, yet.

  If the installing does not work with the exception of the header file:
  try entering individual sudirectories and do a 'qmake && make install'
  there.


  For other operating systems (including other Unixes)

    qmake
    make
  optional (you'll need to be root/administrator for that)
    make install
    ldconfig

  A lack of objects for tests makes the second approach rather untested but it
  can be assumed that your are either a programmer who knows what to do or just
  bold enough to compile your stuff yourself.
